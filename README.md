# Ender 3 Pro

This reposity contains all of the modifications I have made to my Ender 3 Pro. This was forked from the official Creality Ender-3 repository, which does not include files for the Ender 3 Pro. However, the only files that are officially open sourced are for the Ender 3. The differences between the Ender 3 and Ender 3 Pro aren't that great, and so most of the mechanical upgrades that I have made are compatible with both the Ender 3 and the Ender 3 Pro, with a few exceptions.
